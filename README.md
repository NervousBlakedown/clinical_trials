Clinical Trial Samples

## About
Today's healthcare industry faces a lot of interesting problems.  In this repo, I explore interesting problems facing the clinical trials portion of this industry.

## Data
Currently, I am generating sample data with python.  Resources like Kaggle and Data-World might be used in the future.

## Business Cases
Before a pharmaceutical company launches their drug, testing in clinical trials is a must.  One of the intersting problems that can be solved with machine learning is identifying potential participants for clinical trials based on their eligibility and medical backgrounds.  In this repo, I create a classification model that uses these features that can be applied in the real world.
